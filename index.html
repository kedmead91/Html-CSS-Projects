      I am a creative individual who has always had a passion for technology, I have always been intrigued with computers and have always been the point of call for my friends and family tech queries.
      My interest grew during my Criminology Degree (BA Hons 2:1), where I studied a module on forensic computing and cybersecurity. So, after my degree I was delighted to be given a chance to study Software Development and Cybersecurity with Tech Talent Academy, this course has fueled my passion and made it grow.
      I also feel that my high attention to detail, problem solving, working under pressure, and other skills I have gained in my degree and previous job roles have really helped in my progression with learning to code.
      I now look forward to learning and progressing as a Junior Software Developer/ Junior Cybersecurity Engineer.
