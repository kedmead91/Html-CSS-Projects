      <h1><u>My Journey to Cybersecurity</u></h1>

      <p class="frontp">

   <br>My journey into technology has started from a young age.
   I have always had a passion for technology and computers ranging from learning how they work to playing games and experimenting with them to create designs,
   invoices and helping my dad to run his business as a artist.
   It was after this that I decided to go to university as a mature student and study Criminology at Birmingham City University where I achieved a 2.1 BA Honors.<br>
   <br>I went to university because I had a curiousty to learn the theories against why people commit crime,
   I enjoyed learning the psychology of why people do certain things in the modern day and in the past.
   It was during university where my curiosty of cybercrime peaked as I studied a module about cybersecurity, this is where I learned I wanted to explore and educate my self further.<br>
   <br>Therefore, during this time I realised I could work in technology a passion of mine, to help prevent crime, I also realised that I could use my degree to help me in my cybersecurity journey. <br>
   <br>I've always been the person that family and friends came to to ask for advice on how to use and fix technology of all kinds from phones, tablets to pcs and televisions. <br>
   <br>So after my university course I realised I would need to do another course to put my other knowledge together with indepth cyberssecurity knowledge and learn how to code. <br>
   <br>Now I am completing my cybersecurity/ coding course I  now hope that I can not just go into the cybersecurity career and bring my previous and new knowledge and skills to the cybersecurity career to help defeat cybercrime but
    also keep up to date in my technological knowledge from the passion I hold for technology and cybersecurity.
